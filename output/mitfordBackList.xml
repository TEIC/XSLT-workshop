         <note>Lisa M. Wilson is Professor in the Department of English and Communication at SUNY
            Potsdam, where she has taught since 2005. Her areas of interest include transatlantic
            Romantic and Victorian era literature, particularly women’s writing and popular forms
            such as the Gothic novel and the literary ballad. She is also interested in book history
            and bibliographical studies, particularly in the study of authorship in the long
            nineteenth century (1780-1900). She has published in <title level="j">European Romantic
               Review</title>, <title level="j">Romanticism on the Net</title> (now <title level="j"
               >RaVon</title>), <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title>, <title level="j">Romantic
               Textualities</title>, and elsewhere. She is currently working on a monograph on
            Romantic-period authorship and literary celebrity. Her work on Digital Mitford thus far
            includes editing and coding Mitford’s <title level="a">Introduction</title> to her
            collected <title level="m">Dramatic Works</title> (1854), a critical memoir that
            recounts the author’s influences and experiences at Covent Garden and Drury Lane in the
            1820s and 30s. It also includes researching Mitford’s publication history for the site’s
            working bibliography, particularly tracking the migration of Mitford’s stories from
            their first publication to their later reappearances in collections and periodicals. A
            Founding Editor of Digital Mitford, she and her teams of student research assistants
            have been at work since 2013 on transcribing, coding, and researching Mitford’s letters
            from 1819 to the early 1820s and on Mitford’s early poems. </note>

            and failed usurper Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, and as Attorney General and Lord
            Chancellor under James I. In 1621, he was prosecuted for corruption and barred from
            further public service. He has been controversially reputed to be homosexual, on the
            grounds that a fellow M.P. called one of his (Bacon's) servingmen <q>his catamite and
               bed-fellow.</q> In 1845 (during Mitford's lifetime), this passage was published for
            the first time.

            to America in 1817 in order to establish a utopian community in the Illinois territory.

            which presented a utopian, anti-clerical, and anti-aristocratic vision of American
            settlement, were believed to be instrumental in encouraging many disaffected Europeans
            to emigrate to the American prairies, and set off a pamphlet war about on the topic of
            American emigration to the so-called English Prairie. (See Eaton, Joseph. The
            Anglo-American Pamphlet War, 1800-1825. New York: Palgrave/Macmillan, 2012). He became
            president of Illinois's first agricultural society, worked against the establishment of
            slavery in the state, and briefly served as Secretary of State for Illinois. He was
            acquainted with Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Edward Coles, and Robert Owen, himself
            the founder of another midwestern utopian community in New Harmony, Indiana.</note>

               including <q>Drum</q>, <q>Tod</q>, and <q>Dodo</q>. He was a member of a minor branch
               of the Mitfords of Mitford Castle in Northumberland. Although later sources would
               suggest that he was a graduate of the University of Edinburgh medical school, there
               is no evidence that he obtained a medical degree and he did not generally refer to

               father and grandfather worked as apothecary-surgeons and it seems likely that he

               addresses as <placeName>Old Alresford</placeName>; they later came to live at Broad
               Street in New Alresford. Their only child to live to adulthood, <persName ref="#MRM"

         <note resp="#lmw">The work’s subtitle refers to to Morris Birkbeck’s <title
               ref="#America_Birkbeck">Notes on a Journey in America, from the coast of Virginia to
               the territory of Illinois</title> and <title ref="#Illinois_Birkbeck">Letters from
               Illinois</title>, works that were believed to be instrumental in encouraging many
            disaffected Europeans to emigrate to the American prairies Birkbeck and Fearon’s works
            were part of an early nineteenth-century pamphlet war about on the topic of American
            emigration to the so-called <q>English Prairie</q>. A second edition of Sketches
            appeared in 1819. In his preface, Fearon claims to be an unbiased observer and reporter
            and implicitly contrasts himself with other writers on the topic: <quote>My Reports were
               originally composed neither with a view to fame nor profit,--neither to exalt a
               country, to support a party, nor to promote a settlement. I have had every motive to
               speak what I thought the truth, and none to conceal or pervert it.</quote> The volume
            is dedicated to <q>The Friends of Civil and Religious Liberty</q>, and the dedication is
            dated <quote>

               <quote>Such [claims afford] Fearon room for statements that seem to emerge from
                  differing, often contradictory ideological predilections. Sometimes he presents
                  himself as an ardent convert to republicanism. At other times he is so fastidious
                  in manners and appearance that he seems to the guardian of an older English
                  probity Americans have recklessly abandoned</quote>
