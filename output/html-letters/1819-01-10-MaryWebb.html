               Sunday. 
               [10 Jan. 1819]
               
               
               </p>
            
            
            <p>Pray, my very dear Friends, which of us has a right to be angry for not having heard
               yesterday? You? or I? Or neither? Solve me this knotty point. I am sure there is cause
               for anger some where--&amp; I rather think that you <em style="color:red;">Mary</em> have reason good to be in a passion for my not coming to see you--&amp; that I have an
               equal right to be in a fury for not getting a note--in short that every body has cause
               to be angry--except <em style="color:red;">Miss Eliza</em>--who not being at all in the habit of using it will not mind our taking away her
               privilege. So <em style="color:red;">Mary</em>, My Dear, you &amp; I will be properly angry--a little gentle anger which serves like
               a glass of Champagne this cold weather to keep us warm &amp; make us laugh &amp; blush--you
               &amp; I will be angry &amp; then we will make it up in the customary formula of an apologizing
               letter de part &amp; d'autre. First of all for me, I have away much against my will I assure you--All the week till Saturday, I had so bad a cold that <em style="color:red;">Papa</em> would not let me stir--then Saturday--yesterday I mean--was Saturday you know--&amp; the horrible Bench and so forth--&amp; today was so illnatured as to rain--&amp;
               tomorrow <em style="color:red;">Papa</em> is going coursing--&amp; Tuesday the Quarter Sessions deuce take them! &amp; Wednesday &amp; the latter end of the week he expects to be going to <em style="color:red;">Town</em>--so I must write to beg pardon--&amp; you must write to forgive--write &amp; bring me your letter yourself, my own dear little <em style="color:red;">Madame de Sévigné</em>--won't you? Can't you? It seems such an age since I have seen you--&amp; since the mountain cannot come to <em style="color:red;">Mahomet</em> <em style="color:red;">Mahomet</em> should come to the Mountain--I have an infinite respect for old proverbs--especially when they make for my purpose.
               See that you obey this one.</p>  
            
            
            <p> I take it for granted, my dear Friend, that <em style="color:red;">Eliza</em> gave you all the particulars of the Ball--We wanted you very much indeed--which was
               a proof that the ball was worth going to. It had indeed great elegance, great sociability,
               a delightful host, an enchanting hostess--&amp; above all it had <em style="color:red;">Mr. Crowther</em>. This man kept me alive &amp; lifelich (as old <em style="color:red;">Chaucer</em> says) all the evening. Oh my dear <em style="color:red;">Mary</em> I would give a great deal that you could see him--You have never seen anything like
               him--never unless you have seen a wasp in a Solar Microscope (an insect turned into
               a monster)--or unless you can imagine a <em style="color:red;">Brobdingnagian</em> Hourglass --but neither wasp nor hourglass are small enough in the waist for this Dandy--this
               Exquisite--I have all my life had a great respect for the mechanical inventions of
               this age, but nothing that I have ever seen has given me such an idea of the power
               of machinery--not your <em style="color:red;">Father</em>'s melting machine--not the <em style="color:red;">Portsmouth Blockhouses</em>--not the <em style="color:red;">new Mint</em>--as that wonderful effort of mechanism by which those ribs are endued in those stays.
               I do think he must have had one or two ribs broken on each side to make them lie closer.
               The compression would be incredible without some such expedient. But I am unjust in
               talking so much of the stays when it is the Altogether that is so perfect.  Coat, handkerchief, shirt collar, head inside &amp; out, all were in exact keeping--all
               belonged to those inimitable stays &amp; could not have belonged to  else. I never took such a fancy to in my Life--I have seen nothing at all equal to it--Since <em style="color:red;">Liston</em> in <em style="color:red;">Lord Grizzel</em>--It was quite the charm of the evening to me at least, such a charm as a top is to
               a schoolboy--or a hoop--or as my grave cat <em style="color:red;">Selim</em> is to my frisky puppy <em style="color:red;">Miranda</em>. I am sorry to say the admiration was by no means mutual. The Dandy was an ungrateful Dandy--&amp;  away at the sound of my voice just as <em style="color:red;">Mossy</em> (begging <em style="color:red;">Mossy</em>'s pardon for the comparison) flies off at the sight of our dog-hating cook. He told
               a discreet friend who told me that he had an "idea" (a very bold assertion by the
               bye) "an idea that I was Blueish."--Mr. Dandy Good Night--Thank you for a great deal of the best thing in the world--a
               great deal of laughter. Tell dear <em style="color:red;">Eliza</em> that I wished for her as well as for you all Friday &amp; almost all Saturday. Friday was a delightful day--<em style="color:red;">Mr. D.</em> was just as if nothing had happened--<em style="color:red;">Mrs. Dickinson</em> more than usually charming--languid gentle delicate tender like <em style="color:red;">wood sorrel</em>, or <em style="color:red;">lilies of the valley</em> so drooping &amp; so sweet--only just enough alive to sing more sweetly than I ever heard
               even her that enchanting song of <em style="color:red;">Handel</em>'s (which <em style="color:red;">Eliza</em> must learn) <em style="color:red;">"Where'er you walk."</em>--In the evening we had a good deal of literature, English &amp; Italian. <em style="color:red;">Mr. Dickinson</em> read me some fine Translations from <em style="color:red;">Dante</em> &amp;c--with one of which I was so charmed as to beg a Copy--to my sorrow. The copy was
               graciously granted on condition that I would transcribe it for the Author--to which polite request I of course acceded,
               quite forgetting that my accomplished friend wrote a fine rapid crabbed learned-looking
               hand which might pass for Greek or Persian or Arabic just as well as for English.
               So that I have been obliged to copy this translation--half from recollection--half from guess--&amp; half from the original
               Italian. (<em style="color:red;">Eliza</em> who is so great an Arithmetician must tell you how I can be divided into three halves
               by any but an Irish method of Calculation) I have however done it at last &amp; some time
               or other I will read it you. It is the celebrated Episode of <em style="color:red;">Count Ugolino</em> in <em style="color:red;">Dante</em>'s <em style="color:red;">Inferno</em>. Don't imitate  the discretion of <em style="color:red;">Mr. Crowther</em>'s friend by telling <em style="color:red;">Mrs. Dickinson</em> when she calls, which I know she intends to do soon, that I can't read her <em style="color:red;">husband</em>'s hand, I entreat you my dear<em style="color:red;">Mary</em>. On Saturday I went with her into <em style="color:red;">Reading</em> &amp; home to dinner. This is the history of my visit. Ever since I have been at home
               as quiet as a mouse--reading all day long. First of all I have read <em style="color:red;">6 Volumes of <em style="color:red;">Burke</em></em>--of which I will have the compassion not to talk at present--you don't want to hear
               about old pamphlets, old speeches &amp; old American Wars--Then for the second time <em style="color:red;">Mr. Fearon</em>'s very clever bran new <em style="color:red;">book</em> about <em style="color:red;">America</em>. I don't know any thing more agreeable than to have one's preconceived notions of
               a place or people confined by a good citable authority--a matter of fact authority
               who brings one in a tangible shape good reasons for old prejudices. This is the pleasure
               <em style="color:red;">Mr. Fearon</em> has given me. I always defended <em style="color:red;">America</em> &amp; the <em style="color:red;">Americans</em> (all but <em style="color:red;">Franklin</em> &amp; <em style="color:red;">Washington</em>) without very well knowing why--except that in that fair &amp; fresh &amp; beautiful world
               with every thing to inspire &amp; incite them to excellence in Art &amp; Nature--they had
               done nothing &amp; they were nothing. <em style="color:red;">Mr. Fearon</em> has now added positive to these negative proofs &amp; has fairly set them forth as the
               most boasting, vainglorious, ignorant, trumpery, second-hand, pawnbrokers-shop--sort
               of people that ever crept on the face of the earth. His book is invaluable &amp; an antidote
               to the poison of <em style="color:red;">Mr. Birkbeck</em>'s beautifully written but most deceitful works--an antidote the more powerful &amp; the
               more certain as coming from a friend to liberty &amp; an admirer of the republican form
               of Government. I think you would like these <em style="color:red;">Sketches of America</em>--&amp; I am sure you would like a book which I have just finished--<em style="color:red;">Nightmare Abbey</em>. By far  the best of <em style="color:red;">Mr. Peacock</em>'s works--worth all his prose &amp; all his poetry <em style="color:red;">Melincourt</em> &amp; <em style="color:red;">Rhododaphne</em> included--Never was a more cheerful &amp; amicable piece of persiflage--full of laughing
               raillerie &amp; smiling philosophy--Notwithstanding the gloomy title <em style="color:red;">Nightmare Abbey</em> is the most sunshiny book I have met with this many a day. It is a very clever attack
               upon mystical metaphysics &amp; misanthropical poetry (Deuce take <em style="color:red;">Mr. Peacock</em> for putting me to hard words!) and knocks them both completely down in the persons
               of my poor dear Friend <em style="color:red;">Mr. Coleridge</em> ( alias <em style="color:red;">Mr. Flosky</em> &amp; <em style="color:red;">Lord Byron</em>--not only knocks them down but dances on them being down, as his unruly subjects
               did on poor <em style="color:red;">Sancho</em> in the <em style="color:red;">Island of Barataria</em>. Nothing was ever better managed than the way in which <em style="color:red;">Mr. Peacock</em> contrives to put divers stanzas of <em style="color:red;">Childe Harolde</em> done into prose, into the Mouth of <em style="color:red;">Mr. Cypress</em>, the <em style="color:red;">Lord Byron</em> of the story. The book has another great merit. It is short.--Well then I have had
               a pretty present in the book way--a present from dear dear <em style="color:red;">Papa</em>--he who gives me all that I wish for as if by intuition--for I am sure I never hinted
               at it to him or anyone--This present is the <em style="color:red;">Literary Pocket Book</em>--Have you seen one of them my dear <em style="color:red;">Mary</em>?  It is edited I believe by <em style="color:red;">Leigh Hunt</em>--certainly the greater part is written by him--&amp; exceedingly well written. I have
               never seen anything of the sort so well executed. First of all there is a Naturalist's
               Calendar--very graceful &amp; beautiful--though not quite extensive enough for the Title--It
               should rather have been called the Florist's Calendar--&amp; even then it would seem a
               little Suburbian--rather Hampstead-Heathish--but very pretty nevertheless. Then in the common pocket book part, the blank
               pages with months  &amp; weeks &amp; days, there are occasional notices of birthdays of great men <em style="color:red;">Bacon</em> <em style="color:red;">Shakespeare</em> &amp; so forth which come upon one very pleasantly--Then lists of living Artists Musicians
               Actors &amp; celebrated Authors--only think of their having left me out!--That Authorial
               list is very incomplete! Not a word about me!  And my own friends too!  Oh they have
               no idea that I am "Blueish" to borrow my friend the Dandy's phrase.--He would have stuck me at the head of the
               list. Well these lists in spite of this grand omission are very interesting--&amp; then
               there is poetry--not quite so good as I expected from <em style="color:red;">Leigh Hunt</em> &amp; <em style="color:red;">John Keats</em>, but still good enough to stare &amp; wonder how it came in a pocket book. In short,
               My Dear Love, if your dear <em style="color:red;">Papa</em> should be wanting to make you such a present I would recommend him--to make this.--I
               have lost a literary friend this last week--poor <em style="color:red;">Mrs. Brunton</em> the Authoress of <em style="color:red;">Self Control</em> &amp; <em style="color:red;">Discipline</em>. Did I ever talk to you about her? If I did, it was probably under the name of <em style="color:red;">Mrs. Discipline</em>--the name by which <em style="color:red;">Mrs. Rowden</em> (who disliked à l'envie both her &amp; her works) always used to call her. You are not likely to have admired
               her Novels which always seemed to me to have almost all the faults that very clever
               writing can have--preachy--prosy--false to character, to nature, &amp; to passion--yet
               with occasional flashes of sense &amp; of power which rendered their merits &amp; their faults
               alike incomprehensible. I liked the lady much better than her books. She was exceedingly
               robust in mind &amp; person--perhaps in both a little coarse--large boned--dark complexioned--ruddy
               cheeked--of loud speech &amp; abrupt manner. But there was in all she said point &amp; strength
               &amp; body. She was perfectly frank &amp; unaffected, &amp; her very awkwardness had sometimes a grace
                from its natural &amp; unconscious simplicity. Now that she is dead poor thing I wish
               I had cultivated her acquaintance more earnestly. I used to meet her at the house
               of some very clever people in <em style="color:red;">Sloane Street</em> where we were both intimate--but I did not like <em style="color:red;">her husband</em> who was exceedingly priggish &amp; parsonic that was one reason, &amp; vanity, which I suppose
               at the time I might call modesty, was another. She was always very kind &amp; civil to
               me, but it was perfectly clear that she thought me over-rated and did not care a farthing
               for me. Besides I never could get over those sermonizing books. You would see that
               she died in a very distressed way after the birth of a dead child the first she had had in a twenty years marriage. She looked near fifty when
               I used to see her some years ago.</p>
            
            
            <p>I was so sorry to miss seeing <em style="color:red;">Martha Seward</em>--dear sweet girl--If she comes to you again to spend any time pray bring her here.--Did <em style="color:red;">Miss Eliza</em> tell you that she met <em style="color:red;">young Parfitt (Mr. Joseph)</em> whom we thought a very fine gentlemanly young man &amp; that he was very attentive to
               the aforesaid <em style="color:red;">Miss Eliza</em>? And that we liked <em style="color:red;">Miss Sarah Parfitt</em> very much who gave an almost equal specimen of good taste by falling in love with
               me? Making <em style="color:red;">Miss Sarah</em> laugh was my charm--I don't know what enchantment <em style="color:red;">Miss Eliza</em> put in force with <em style="color:red;">Mr. Joseph</em>--However I have given my consent &amp; I beg my dear <em style="color:red;">Mary</em>, if you have a dance that <em style="color:red;">the Parfitt's</em> may be asked. I assure you you would not be at all shamed of your brother in law.
               We met a <em style="color:red;">Mrs. Coffin</em> too whom I liked much--She talked of books with taste &amp; selections with something too of that wide range which is my delight--old books--odd books--rare boooks--I hate <em style="color:red;">Homer</em> who tread only the beaten road of literature marching one by onein the same pathlike a great brood of full grown geese after an old gander. People should talk of <em style="color:red;">Isaac Walton</em> &amp; <em style="color:red;">Jeremy Taylor</em> &amp; <em style="color:red;">Sir Thomas Brown</em> &amp; <em style="color:red;"></em>Fletcher &amp; <em style="color:red;">Froissart</em>&amp; <em style="color:red;">de Joinville</em> &amp; <em style="color:red;">Pulci</em>--&amp; talk as if they had read the books &amp; not reviews or extracts of them.</p>
            
            <p>--In the mean time my dear <em style="color:red;">Mary</em> I am forgetting that you do not like any works that are too voluminous--&amp; that this
               letter is of a length to startle even partial eyes. I have the grace to pity you for
               being condemned to read it. Write soon--Come soon--Writing without coming will not
               do--nor coming without writing. Imitate me in length, my dearest, but not in dullness--A
               very needless caution! Dullness is not in your power.--Love to all &amp; every body--<em style="color:red;">Papa</em>--<em style="color:red;">Eliza</em>--<em style="color:red;">Aunt Mary</em>--<em style="color:red;">Uncle John</em>--<em style="color:red;">Kate Wheeler</em>--Love to all &amp; from all.</p>
            <p>--Ever my very dear Friend most faithfully <br/><em style="color:red;">M.R. Mitford</em>.<br/></p>  
            
            
            <p>
