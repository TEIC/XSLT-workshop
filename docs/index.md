## Navigating and Processing Data from the TEI with XSLT

Welcome to our workshop! We are going to investigate how well TEI and XSLT can connect the encoding and processing of documents across language and cultural differences.  

### Description and goals
Knowing how to navigate and explore data in your encoding can be an important way to learn how to work with TEI and XML generally. This workshop is designed for people who have some experience with markup languages and seek to learn more about how to work with digital scholarly editions as a basis for analysis and research. Markup in documents supplies structures and contexts that are particularly useful for processing data beyond what we can do with so-called "plain text". Our workshop will teach the pull-processing of data from XML/TEI with simple, reusable XSLT templates to represent in simple TSV/CSV and HTML tables/charts.

### Preparation
We will be working with the oXygen XML Editor in this workshop, which you should [install on your computer from here](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor/download_oxygenxml_editor.html) or update to the latest version if you already have it. If you are installing oXygen for the first time, note that oXygen comes with Author, Editor, and Developer versions. We will be using the Editor version in this workshop. oXygen comes with a free 30-day trial license key.
