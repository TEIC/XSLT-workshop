# Workshop XPath expressions 


- What XPath would find the paragraphs in the file?
- What XPath identifies the \<salute\> elements inside the \<closer\>?   
- What XPath would find the name of the sender?
- What XPath will find all the person names encoded in the letter? How many of these are there?

The following questions only apply to the Spanish example:
- What XPath will find all the nouns (pos='N')?
- How many of these are there? 
- What XPath will find all the nouns which are directly preceded by a determiner (pos='C')?
