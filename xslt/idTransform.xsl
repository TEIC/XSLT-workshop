<!-- 2024-08-23 ebb: This is an identity transformation stylesheet.
    Where there is no template rule to match, the default behavior 
    is set to output a shallow copy of each node, that is the node 
    and its children. The only template rules we write are 
    for what we wish to change.
    
    Input: We have designed this XSLT to process the Spanish TEI letter: 
    es_PS4000-TEIP5.xml and alter its tagging.
    
    In the first template rule, we are matching <persName> elements and replacing their tags with 
    <name type="person">. The contents of the element remain exactly the same in the output. (Look for the changes
    in the TEI header. 
    
    In the second template rule, we are removing the <w> element tags and processing only their
    contents. This is a convenient way to remove tags from your file without losing their content.
    
    Output is stored at output/id-transform-esLetter.xml
